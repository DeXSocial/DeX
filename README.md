🎉 Welcome to DeX! 🎉

Embark on a unique social experiment to explore the market capitalization limits of a memecoin without relying on Twitter(X) for its propagation.

🚀 Project Goals 🚀
Our project is driven by the following core objectives:

💡 Challenge Traditional Memecoin Propagation:

Objective: Investigate whether a memecoin can achieve significant market traction and value without the viral spread typically facilitated by Twitter.
🤝 Harness Community-Driven Growth:

Objective: Rely exclusively on GitHub and our community for communication, contributions, and promotion, demonstrating the power of an engaged and active community as the primary growth engine.
🔗 Pioneer Decentralized Propagation Strategies:

Objective: Develop and understand effective methods for promoting and advancing digital assets without centralized social platforms, laying the groundwork for future decentralized promotion techniques.
📚 Document Natural Memecoin Growth:

Objective: Objectively record the development journey of our memecoin, capturing community building efforts, value fluctuations, and other critical aspects without the influence of Twitter.
