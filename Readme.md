3. **🔗 Pioneer Decentralized Propagation Strategies:**
   - **Objective:** Develop and understand effective methods for promoting and advancing digital assets without centralized social platforms, laying the groundwork for future decentralized promotion techniques.
4. **📚 Document Natural Memecoin Growth:**
   - **Objective:** Objectively record the development journey of our memecoin, capturing community building efforts, value fluctuations, and other critical aspects without the influence of Twitter.
